# Feynman Dataset Regression with PHCRegressor

This repository demonstrates the application of the **PHCRegressor** for performing regression on the **Feynman dataset**, which consists of symbolic mathematical equations derived from fundamental physical laws. The goal is to accurately predict and model these complex relationships using the PHCRegressor, a specialized machine-learning algorithm for symbolic regression.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To model complex mathematical equations in the Feynman dataset using the PHCRegressor.
- **PHCRegressor**: Utilizes polynomial, harmonic, and chaotic functions to address the datasetâ€™s non-linearity and diversity.
- **Dataset**: Contains over 100 equations representing fundamental physical relationships, known for their challenging nature.

## Key Features

- **Model Implementation**: Includes the PHCRegressor model with training, validation, and testing procedures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preparing the dataset for regression analysis.
- **Results Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation with error metrics, visualizations, and comparisons with other regression techniques.
- **Reproducibility**: All code and instructions provided to replicate experiments or adapt the model for other tasks.
