# Feynman_symbolic_regression_MLH
This repository showcases the use of the PHCRegressor for regression on the Feynman dataset, which includes symbolic equations from fundamental physical laws. The PHCRegressor, designed for symbolic regression, uses polynomial, harmonic, and chaotic functions to tackle the datasetâ€™s non-linearity and complexity
